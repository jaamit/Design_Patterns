# Iterator pattern - GoF Object Behavioral pattern

•	Access/Iterate elements of an aggregate/collection without exposing its representation

•	Decouples algorithms from containers 

•	C++ STL Iterators have "value-semantics."

•	Java - Iterable interface returns an Iterator that can be traversed using Java's foreach loop syntax.

• C++11 range-based for loops & Java foreach loops
